xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><fr:p>The UNIX system contains two types of devices, block devices and raw or character devices.

<fr:p>The user interface to devices goes through the file system (recall Figure 2.1): Every device has a name that looks like a file name and is accessed like a file. The device special file has an inode and occupies a node in the directory hierarchy of the file system. The device file is distinguished from other files by the file type stored in its inode, either "block" or "character special," corresponding to the device it represents. If a device has both a block and character interface, it is represented by two device files: its block device special file and its character device special file. System calls for regular files, such as <fr:code>open</fr:code>, <fr:code>close</fr:code>, <fr:code>read</fr:code>, and <fr:code>write</fr:code>, have an appropriate meaning for devices, as will be explained later. The <fr:code>foeti</fr:code> system call provides an interface that allows processes to control character devices, but it is not applicable to regular files.[1] However, each device driver need not support every system call interface.

  <html:blockquote
xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><fr:p>I/O devices can be roughly divided into two categories: <html:dfn>block devices</html:dfn> and <html:dfn>character devices</html:dfn>. A block device is one that stores information in fixed-size blocks, each one with its own address. Common block sizes range from 512 bytes to 32,768 bytes. The essential property of a block device is that it is possible to read or write each block independently of all the other ones. Disks are the most common block devices.</fr:p>

<fr:p>If you look closely, the boundary between devices that are block addressable and those that are not is not well defined. Everyone agrees that a disk is a block addressable device because no matter where the arm currently is, it is always possible to seek to another cylinder and then wait for the required block to rotate under the head. Now consider a tape drive used for making disk backups. Tapes contain a sequence of blocks. If the tape drive is given a command to read block <fr:tex
display="inline"><![CDATA[N]]></fr:tex>, it can always rewind the tape and go forward until it comes to block <fr:tex
display="inline"><![CDATA[N]]></fr:tex>. This operation is analogous to a disk doing a seek, except that it takes much longer.  Also, it may or may not be possible to rewrite one block in the middle of a tape.  Even if it were possible to use tapes as random access block devices, that is stretching the point somewhat: they are not normally used that way.</fr:p>

<fr:p>The other type of I/O device is the character device. A character device delivers or accepts a stream of characters, without regard to any block structure. It is not addressable and does not have any seek operation. Printers, network interfaces, mice (for pointing), rats (for psychology lab experiments), and most other devices that are not disk-like can be seen as character devices.</fr:p>

<fr:p>This classification scheme is not perfect. Some devices just do not fit in. Clocks, for example, are not block addressable. Nor do they generate or accept character streams. All they do is cause interrupts at well-defined intervals. Still, the model of block and character devices is general enough that it can be used as a basis for making some of the operating system software dealing with I/O device independent. The file system, for example, deals only with abstract block devices and leaves the device-dependent part to lower-level software called device drivers.</fr:p></html:blockquote>
