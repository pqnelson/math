\p{Let #{X} be a set, let #{\mathcal{B}} be an arbitrary family of subsets of #{X} such that #{\bigcup\mathcal{B}=X} (i.e., they cover #{X}). Then we may define the \define{Topology Generated} by #{\mathcal{B}} to be the collection #{\mathcal{T}} of subsets of #{X} such that:
\ul{\li{A subset #{U\subset X} is an element of #{\mathcal{T}} if for each #{x\in U} there exists a #{B\in\mathcal{B}} such that #{x\in B} and #{B\subset U}.}}}

\rmk{This defines a term "topology generated", but it does not necessarily mean that it's actually a [[gt-0001]] for #{X}. We need to prove it in the next theorem.}
