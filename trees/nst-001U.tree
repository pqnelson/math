\p{Let #{A} be a set, let #{B} be a countably infinite set. Then #{A} is countably infinite iff there is a bijection #{f\colon A\to B}.}

\proof{\p{Let #{g\colon B\to\NN} be an injective function (since #{B} is countable). If #{f\colon A\to B} is bijective, then #{g\circ f} is injective, hence #{A} is countable.}
\p{If #{A} is countably infinite, then there is a bijection #{g\colon A\to\NN}. We have #{h\colon B\to\NN} be bijective (since #{B} is countable). Then #{h^{-1}\circ g\colon A\to B} is bijective.}}
