\p{Let #{(X,d)} be a [[ca-000K]]. We can define the \define{Metric Topology} for #{X} consisting of all [open subsets](ca-000M) (defined using open balls) as the only open sets in the topology.}

\rmk{We should look at point-set topology as generalizing everything from our discussion about the [[ca-000G]] to arbitrary sets.}
