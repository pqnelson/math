\p{Let #{\kk} be a [[nt-004K]]. The ring of [[nt-004L]] #{\AlgInt{\kk}} is an [[ra-000H]] and its [field of fractions](ra-002B) is #{\kk}.}

\p{\textbf{Proof idea:} Suffices to show #{\AlgInt{\kk}} is closed under addition and multiplication. Then it's an integral domain since it's a subring of a field.}
