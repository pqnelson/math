\p{We can take advantage of the fact that "If #{P} then #{Q}" has the same truth table as "If not #{Q}, then not #{P}". This "Not #{Q} implies not #{P}" is called the \define{Contrapositive} of "#{P} implies #{Q}". Usually we embark on a [[nst-002G]] and so the proof looks like:}
\blockquote{Assume not #{Q}. [Intermediate proof steps.] Hence not #{P}.}
