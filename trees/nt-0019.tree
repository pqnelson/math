\p{If #{\LL / \kk} is an [algebraic extension](nt-000T), and if #{\kk / \FF} is an algebraic extension, then #{\LL / \FF} is an algebraic extension.}

\proof{\p{Since #{\LL / \kk} is algegbra, any #{\alpha\in\LL} is algebraic over #{\kk}. Then #{\alpha} is algebraic over #{\FF} since [elements of #{\LL} which are algebraic over #{\kk} are also algebraic over #{\FF}](nt-0018).}}
