\p{Let #{\alpha\in\kk} be [algebraic](nt-000T) over #{\FF}, the [unique monic polynomial](nt-000V) #{m_{\alpha}\in\FF[x]}, which has #{\alpha} as a root, is called the \define{Minimal Polynomial} of #{\alpha} over #{\FF}. The \define{degree} of #{\alpha} over #{\FF} is the degree of its minimal polynomial.}

\p{(We've already [proved this is well-defined](nt-000V).)}
