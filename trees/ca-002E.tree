\p{Let #{(X,d)} and #{(Y,\rho)} be [[ca-000K]]s. Let #{F} be a family of functions from #{X} to #{Y}. We say #{F} is \define{Uniformly Equicontinuous} if for any #{f\in F}, for each #{\varepsilon>0} there is a #{\delta>0} such that for any #{x,y\in X}, if #{d(x,y)<\delta} then #{\rho(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon}.}

\rmk{\p{(1) Observe that each function in a uniformly equicontinuous collection is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not always true.}
\p{(2) A family of functions is broadly considered "equicontinuous" if all functions in the family are continuous and have equal variation over a given neighborhood (in a precise sense).}}
