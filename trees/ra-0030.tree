\p{At this point, we have studied two algebraic gadgets (groups and rings), as well as many other gadgets in other fields.}

\p{There are common things to look for when we define a "gadget":}
\ul{
\li{Products of gadgets}
\li{Sub-gadgets}
\li{Quotients of gadgets}
\li{Morphisms between gadgets}
\li{Isomorphism theorems}
\li{Some attempt to classify gadgets}
