\p{Let #{(X,d)} be a [[ca-000K]] and #{(Y,\rho)} be a [[ca-001F]]. Let #{f_{n}\colon X\to Y} be a sequence of functions. Then #{(f_{n})} is [uniformly convergent](ca-002A) if and only if it is [[ca-002B]].}

\proof{\p{\forwardproof Obvious.}
\p{\backwardproof Straightforward unfolding of definitions, and appeal to the triangle inequality.}}
