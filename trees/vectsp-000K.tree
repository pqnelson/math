\p{If we are just given any two vector spaces #{V_{1}} and #{V_{2}} over the same field #{\FF}, then we can still form the direct sum of these spaces. We just take #{V_{1}\oplus V_{2}=\{(v_{1},v_{2})\mid v_{1}\in V_{1},v_{2}\in V_{2}\}} and the operations are defined componentwise.}

\p{This is known as the \define{External Direct Sum}, but it is not taught usually to undergraduates.}
