\p{Let #{V} be an [[vectsp-0020]] over #{\FF}, let #{L\colon V\to V} be a linear operator. If there is some basis #{B} of #{V} such that #{L} is an upper-triangular matrix with respect to #{B}, then there exists an orthonormal basis #{C} of #{V} such that #{L} is an upper triangular matrix with respect to #{C}.}
