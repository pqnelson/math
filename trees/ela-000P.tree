\p{Not all vector spaces have a well-defined "dot product". The only one which has an obvious dot product is [the vector space of #{n}-tuples #{\RR^{n}}](ela-000G), where we define:}

##{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\cdot(y_{1},\dots,y_{n})=\sum^{n}_{j=1}x_{j}y_{j}}

\p{We will just take for granted this is a well-defined notion for #{\RR^{n}}.}
