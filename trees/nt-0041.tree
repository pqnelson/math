\p{Let #{R_{n}(M)} be the number of polynomials of degree #{n} with coefficients #{|a_{i}|\leq M} and whose Galois group is not #{S_{n}}. Then
##{R_{n}(M)\ll M^{n-1/2}\log(M).}}

Gallagher improved an earlier result of van der Waerden. See also Dietmann's "Probabilistic Galois Theory" (\arXiv{1111.2853}) for recent developments.}
