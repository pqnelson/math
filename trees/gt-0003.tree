\p{Let #{(X,\mathcal{T})} be a [[gt-0002]]. Let #{x\in X} be a point. A \define{Neighborhood} of #{x} is an open subset #{U} of #{X} which contains #{x\in U}.}

\rmk{Some authors in older topology texts use a slightly different definition of a neighborhood. So just be careful when consulting a text if they use neighborhoods.}
