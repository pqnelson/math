\p{Let #{\ZZ_{4}} be the set of integers modulo 4. This is a commutative group. Let #{\ZZ_{2}} be the set of integers modulo 2. This is a subgroup of #{\ZZ_{4}} (just look at the subgroup generated by #{[2]}).}
\p{Then the quotient group #{\ZZ_{4} / \ZZ_{2}\iso\ZZ_{2}} is isomorphic to #{\ZZ_{2}}. But
##{(\ZZ_{4} / \ZZ_{2})\times\ZZ_{2}\not\iso\ZZ_{4}.}}
