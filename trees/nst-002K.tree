\p{If we have a claim which is a formula indexed by natural numbers #{P[n]}, then a proof by induction on #{n} looks like:}
\ol{
\li{\textbf{Base case:} For #{n=0} (or #{n=1}), prove #{P[0]} (resp., #{P[1]}).}
\li{\textbf{Inductive argument:} For arbitrary #{n}, prove the claim "If #{P[n]} then #{P[n+1]}". Usually this is done by a [[nst-002G]] and we call the statement "Assume #{P[n]}" the \define{Inductive Hypothesis}.}
