\p{When we define a new sort of "morphism" (function between gadgets, like linear transformations), it is always good practice to check if the identity function qualifies. Let #{V} be any real vector space. We claim #{\id_{V}\colon V\to V} the identity function on #{V} is a linear operator.}

\p{This is a linear transformation since #{\id_{V}(c_{1}u+c_{2}v)=c_{1}u+c_{2}v=c_{1}\id_{V}(u)+c_{2}\id_{V}(v)}.}
